# Bitrise step - Mobile apps decompiler

Decompile mobile APK and/or IPA

This step will get/download your APK/IPA and decompile them to:
- apk_decompiled/
- ipa_unzipped/

<br/>

## Usage

Add this step using standard Workflow Editor and provide required input environment variables.

<br/>

You can launch this step:
- directly in the step where you generate your APK/IPA, in that case, you have to launch it necessarily after these build steps
- **OR** in another Bitrise build than where you generate your APK/IPA, in that case, you have to setup `outside_build_slug` to download your APK/IPA to do quality checks
